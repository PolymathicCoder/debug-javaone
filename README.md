Debugging: The Missing Episode - 
=============
[TUT7007] JavaOne 2014


This session’s speaker has yet to meet a software engineer who jumps out of his or her chair in excitement at the thought of fixing one of his or her bugs, let alone other people's. It can be a frustrating task and sometimes “twice as hard as writing a program in the first place,” in the words of Brian Kernighan, who needs no introduction. In this session, you will be exposed to a more systematic and rigorous approach to debugging and will be introduced to several techniques and methods inspired by modern studies in cognitive psychology, the philosophy of science, and other fields. You never know—you might end up changing your mind about your favorite part of being a software engineer after all.
